# Style Dictionary examples for TokensBrücke

This is the repo with the [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) examples for the [TokensBrücke](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1254538877056388290) Figma plugin.

## Installation

Go to an example folder:

```bash
cd examples/base
```

Install the dependencies with npm or yarn:

```bash
# with npm
npm install

# or with yarn
yarn
```

Then run the build script:

```bash
# with npm
npm run build

# or with yarn
yarn build

## Base

In this example we transform a design tokens file into a CSS file. The tokens file was exported with TokensBrücke without DTCG format (all property names without `$` prefix).
